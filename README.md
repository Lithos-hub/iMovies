iMovies is a web application developed by me using Vue + Vuetify.

This application uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to show info about movies (release dates, titles, vote average, overviews, etc).

Since I started developing it at October 2019, a tons of changes have been added, such as global visual and design improvements; internationalization (English / Spanish); a login/register backend using Google Firebase Authentication; a movies CRUD backend system using Google Firebase Firestore; navigation guard or a Trivia game (available in Beta phase since version 2.3.0).

This application is under continuous development.
